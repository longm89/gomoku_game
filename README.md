In this project, I created a board game called Gomoku. In this game, the person who gets the first Five marks in a line wins.   
The bot in this game is implemented using the Minimax algorithm. The game is created using React, CSS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.   
The game can be played at: http://cocarogame.herokuapp.com/
